# Tap Customer Service Introduction

Tap Game Customer Service assists the game operations team in solving the problems encountered by players faster and better.

## Key Benefits

### Rich tools to improve customer service efficiency

Tap Game Customer Service consists of two core systems: Ticket and Knowledge Base, providing a set of freely combinable functional modules, including announcements, FAQs, forms, etc., to solve players' problems and requests.

- The ticket module comes with the category-based auto-assignment function. You can also customize triggers to achieve a more complex assignment mechanism that can quickly assign tickets to the most appropriate staff members.
    
- Tickets support custom fields that can be filled in by the player via a form or actively reported by the developer, providing detailed context for customer service.
    
- Multiple notification methods are supported to ensure you don't miss any player responses.
    

### Multi-dimensional analytics to support operations

Tap Game Customer Service is designed to help solve player problems, but it is also designed to help the operation team identify issues, refine and accelerate valuable content, and improve the game itself.

- Tickets have flexible search and filtering capabilities and support aggregation and analysis by classification, field, and status. It also supports data export for further analysis with third-party tools.
    
- Knowledge base articles provide user feedback to see behind the scenes what content is effective and what is not solving the player's problem.
    

### Simple and Powerful Management Features

Tap Game Customer Service provides an intuitive role-based permission control system that supports custom roles in addition to pre-built roles for more flexible needs.

The system provides managers with detailed data to evaluate the quantity and quality of customer service work, including but not limited to the number of tickets handled, the timeliness of responses to players, and player satisfaction.

### User Experience Designed for Players

As a customer service tool focused on gaming scenarios, Tap Game Customer Service provides an in-game customer service experience. Players don't have to switch apps to use the customer service feature, and they can receive in-game prompts immediately after customer service replies.

In addition, the SDK optimizes visuals and interactions for landscape scenarios and provides developers with a control API to reduce the impact of the SDK on the performance of the game's core processes.

### Out-of-the-box development experience

The Tap Game Customer Service client SDK covers popular game development platforms and provides features such as user interface, login, data reporting, and red dot maintenance. The highly integrated features provide an out-of-the-box development experience.

Customer Service supports multiple login methods, including the TDS built-in account feature if the game already uses it, or the game's own account system.
